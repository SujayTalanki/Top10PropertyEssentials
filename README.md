## Top 10 Property Essentials
* Background: The company had many properties, each of which had 10 areas that inspectors were required to assess; inspectors left comments regarding the condition of each area
* Result: Produced a Power BI dashboard that allows business analysts to extract information from 5,000+ inspectorsâ€™ comments regarding the condition of 5,000+ 
  properties. 
* Leveraged Python (pandas, nltk, sentence_transformers, sklearn), Snowflake (SQL), Power Query, and Power BI to create a pipeline that produced
  meaningful conclusions from raw text data
* Implemented a key phrase extraction feature, sentiment analysis classifier (NLP), and Power BI visualizations to analyze
  comments on an aggregate level according to user-selected attributes
* Analysts could filter the results based on the market, region, property type, property manager, etc. in order to visualize the performance
  of select facilities
* NOTE: I don't have access to the data warehouse anymore, so there is an error when using the Power BI dashboard (PowerBIDashboard.png). However, I have attached an image of what
  the missing visuals should look like (check App.png)
